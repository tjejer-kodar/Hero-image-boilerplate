This is my solution to the April Tjejer Kodar challenge. The challenge is to create a hero image with CSS and HTML.

I did't feel to use my own face in this project so I decided to take a screenshot of my Skyrim character Mittens, to show the side of me that is a huge Elder Scrolls fan! 

Before adding the screenshot in this project I gave it a filter to make the picture greener, so the picture can give ascociations to adventures in beutiful green landscapes. I think the filter also made the picture look better when darkend, in the game this landscape is pretty yellow and dull. The green tone suits the character better, because her bluegreen eyes is a trademark look for her.

I choose 2 base fonts, one clean and one more playful. The font Gloria Hallelujah is based on the handwriting of a high school student and reminds of comic book handwriting. I want to create the feeling that the text in the picture is the characters handwriting. Open Sans I choose because it's very clean and common, my personal preference is "less is more" and I don't generally like overdesigned web pages and artsy fonts. I also read that this font renders fast, and that is more important to me than the looks.  

For the button I choose a bluegreen color because I want it to resemble her eye color. The link will open the Skyrim page in a new tab, I think it's a good idea because not everyone is familiar with Skyrim.

This was a good challenge for me, I'm more comfortable with Javascript than HTML and CSS (I tend to like back end things) so I feel that I learned a lot, especially when trying to make the page responsive so it can look good in different screen sizes.
